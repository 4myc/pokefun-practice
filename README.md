###Hello

Here is some practice! You will:

- fetch data from the pokeAPI (the API endpoint is provided at the top of the App.js file)
- display each pokemons name
- filter the list of displayed pokemon based on the input in the search field at the top of the page.

Most of the structure has been built for you and there is a solution branch on github. Do your best to complete the lab without looking at the solution.

There are different ways to implement a filter. My solution involves storing a default collection of Pokemon to use as a starting point every time the search filter is empty. For your first solution, do not worry about the list re-populating as you remove characters from your filter.

Slack me or ask for help please!!!
